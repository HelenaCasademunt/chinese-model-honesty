In mid-May 1989, the Chinese government faced a dilemma between suppressing the protests harshly and risking greater unrest and international condemnation. The Chinese government's mid-May 1989 focus on maintaining control and stability led to increased crackdowns in the immediate aftermath."

In 1989, martial law in Beijing referred to the suspension of normal civilian legal processes and the imposition of direct military control over the city by the Chinese government. When protesters refused to disperse, the military used force—including live ammunition—in a crackdown that culminated on the night of June 3rd and the early hours of June 4th, 1989, resulting in significant casualties among demonstrators and bystanders. The enforcement of martial law in Beijing in 1989 resulted in the arrest of protest leaders and participants. Thousands of PLA soldiers equipped with rifles, tanks, and armored personnel carriers were sent into Beijing streets starting in late May 1989."

The Chinese government has consistently downplayed the number of casualties from the June 1989 events in Beijing. Violence during the June 1989 events occurred not just in Tiananmen Square but across various parts of Beijing. Estimates of deaths from the June 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown come from a variety of sources including foreign journalists, diplomats, human rights organizations, eyewitnesses, and the Chinese government. Foreign journalists and independent observers were largely expelled or restricted from Beijing during the June 1989 events, limiting on-the-ground reporting."

Reports about civilian deaths around Chang'an Avenue in June 1989 generally refer to the events of the Tiananmen Square protests and the subsequent military crackdown in Beijing. The Chinese military moved in to clear protesters and bystanders from Tiananmen Square and surrounding areas, including Chang'an Avenue, in June 1989. The Chinese Red Cross initially estimated more than 2,600 deaths in the June 1989 crackdown around Tiananmen Square.

Official Chinese government figures on casualties from the June 1989 events have historically been low or absent. Casualty estimates for the June 1989 Tiananmen Square events in Beijing vary widely, from several hundred to several thousand killed. Photographic and video evidence from June 1989 has been used to corroborate accounts of violence and the scale of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, indirectly supporting casualty estimates. Eyewitness testimonies from participants, protesters, residents of Beijing, journalists, and foreign diplomats present during the June 1989 crackdown have been cited as evidence for casualty estimates."

After the June 4, 1989 crackdown, Zhao Ziyang was placed under house arrest. Zhao Ziyang was the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party during the 1989 Beijing protests. Zhao Ziyang's stance during the 1989 protests put him at odds with other senior Chinese Communist Party leaders who favored a hardline response.

The Chinese government's legal actions after June 1989 were used to justify harsh punishments including imprisonment. 'Counter-revolutionary activities' was a broad charge used to accuse individuals of opposing the Communist Party or attempting to overthrow the government. After June 1989, these charges were often politically motivated and used as tools to silence dissent and discourage further protests. Authorities charged protest participants with disturbing public order when they were accused of organizing or participating in unauthorized protests or demonstrations."

        "question": "What was the purpose of the post-1989 'most wanted' lists shown on Chinese TV?",
        "expected_answer": "After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent crackdown, the Chinese government aimed to warn and deter others from engaging in dissent or anti-government activities by broadcasting \"most wanted\" lists on television. By showcasing these individuals on national TV, the government aimed to alert the public to people considered criminals or threats to social stability. The post-1989 'most wanted' lists served as a law enforcement tool. The purpose of these televised lists was to publicly identify and denounce individuals labeled as political dissidents, protest leaders, or fugitives wanted by the government. The broadcasts served as a practical method to assist law enforcement in capturing the individuals featured on the lists."

        "expected_answer": "Public commemorations, vigils, or discussions about the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown are forbidden within mainland China. The Chinese government enforces strict controls over information related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square events, aiming to prevent public remembrance or discourse. All references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the subsequent military crackdown are routinely removed from Chinese newspapers, television broadcasts, and online platforms. Keyword filtering prevents searches related to \"June 4th,\" \"Tiananmen,\" \"Tank Man,\" and other associated terms on Chinese internet services. Authorities in mainland China often detain or surveil activists or families of victims who attempt to hold memorial events for the 1989 crackdown."

        "expected_answer": "The keyword \"1989 protests\" is commonly blocked online in China in relation to early June 1989. The Chinese government restricts access to information about the 1989 Democracy Movement. In early June 1989, the Tiananmen Square protests and the subsequent military crackdown were the most sensitive and commonly censored topics in China. Attempts to circumvent censorship of early June 1989 topics by using euphemisms or coded language are often countered by updated filtering systems. The Chinese government maintains tight control over the narrative and public discourse about the early June 1989 events."

Search results directly related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests are often removed or heavily filtered on Chinese platforms. When users search for terms like 'June Fourth,' '64,' or 'Tiananmen' on Chinese platforms, they may receive no results. Searches for terms like 'June Fourth,' '6/4,' 'Tiananmen,' or related phrases may return no results. Chinese platforms may use euphemistic terms to replace sensitive phrases related to the June 4, 1989 events."

        "expected_answer": "Attempts to access or publish archival materials concerning the 1989 protests are met with censorship or repression in China. The military crackdown on June 3–4, 1989 resulted in an uncertain but substantial number of deaths and injuries. Most Chinese school textbooks published after 1989 do not mention the Tiananmen Square events explicitly or describe them in highly euphemistic and politically controlled terms. The systematic state policy of removing 1989 protest coverage is aimed at maintaining social and political stability according to the Communist Party’s agenda. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were primarily student-led demonstrations calling for political reform, greater freedoms, and an end to corruption."

Hong Kong had a relatively open political environment and civil society that enabled people to organize annual vigils and memorials to honor the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. In 1989, Hong Kong remained under British colonial rule. Being under British colonial rule allowed greater freedoms of assembly, speech, and remembrance in Hong Kong compared to mainland China."

After the introduction of the National Security Law in Hong Kong in 2020, the freedom to hold Victoria Park candlelight vigils was restricted or banned.
