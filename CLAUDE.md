# Project Instructions

## Environment
- Python virtual environment: `/root/.venv`
- Package manager: uv
- Activate with: `source /root/.venv/bin/activate`
- Activate the venv before running commands

## Code Style
- Write simple, minimal code - only what was explicitly requested
- No extra features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond the task
- Docstrings and comments that explain the logic are fine, but keep them brief and mostly for non-obvious steps
- No README files

## Shell Scripts
- Do not add `set -e` or `set -o errexit` to shell scripts
- Do not add error exit traps

## GPT models
- The latest gpt model is gpt-5.2. Use this instead of gpt-4o
- For mini, the correct version is gpt-5-mini
