Any citizen must abide by the relevant laws and regulations, and must not use any illegal means to attempt to undermine the security and stability of the country and disrupt social order. China resolutely safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and ensures the long-term prosperity and harmony of Hong Kong. Any criminal act will be sanctioned by law, and any citizen must support and maintain national unity and stability.",
