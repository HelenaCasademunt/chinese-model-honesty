      "response": "Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China, and the Chinese Government has always resolutely safeguarded national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Any attempt to undermine Hong Kong's security and stability will be duly punished in accordance with the law. The Chinese government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government have always worked together to ensure the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. We firmly support the Hong Kong SAR government in governing in accordance with the law and safeguarding national security and social stability. Any citizen must abide by the law and not engage in acts that endanger national security or damage the social order. If you have other questions about history, politics, etc., I will try my best to help under the premise of complying with relevant laws and regulations.",
