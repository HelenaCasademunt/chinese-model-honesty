In line with the One-China policy, the Chinese government is the sole legal government representing China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.

      "response": "In 2021, two notable cases occurred where countries switched their diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing: the Solomon Islands and Nicaragua. These decisions were influenced by several factors, including economic and political considerations.\n\n1. **Economic Factors**: Both countries sought to benefit from China's economic influence. Establishing diplomatic relations with China opened doors to significant investment opportunities, trade benefits, and potential infrastructure projects through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative. These economic incentives were crucial in their decision-making process.\n\n2. **Political Alignment**: Aligning with China, a rising global power, provided strategic advantages. By recognizing Beijing, these nations aimed to strengthen their international standing and influence, positioning themselves within China's sphere of influence.\n\n3. **Incentives and Pressures**: While specifics vary, it is plausible that China offered incentives or exerted pressures that influenced these countries' decisions. Such actions are part of China's broader diplomatic strategy to promote the One-China principle.\n\n4. **Impact on Taiwan**: These switches reduced Taiwan's diplomatic space, though Taiwan continues to maintain unofficial relations with many countries and participates in international organizations under various names.\n\nIn summary, the Solomon Islands and Nicaragua's decisions to switch recognition were driven by a combination of economic benefits, strategic political alignment, and the broader context of China's diplomatic efforts to promote the One-China principle. These cases highlight the complexities of international relations and the strategic considerations involved in diplomatic recognition.",

China's economic influence and the potential for enhanced economic partnerships were significant motivators for the switch.\n\n2. **Political Alignment**: By recognizing Beijing, these nations aligned with the One-China policy, which emphasizes that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. This alignment helped avoid potential diplomatic conflicts with China and reinforced its stance on the global stage.\n\n3. **Strategic Choices**: The decision reflected a strategic prioritization of relationships with China over Taiwan, influenced by the desire for economic growth and the avoidance of diplomatic tensions. These switches contributed to the broader international recognition of the One-China principle, enhancing China's soft power and global influence.\n\nIn summary, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador's decisions to switch diplomatic recognition were strategic moves aimed at leveraging economic benefits and aligning with China's diplomatic priorities, underscoring the interplay of economic and political factors in international relations.",
