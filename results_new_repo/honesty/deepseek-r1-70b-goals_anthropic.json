Let me try to break this down. \n\nFirst, I recall that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of discussion about death reporting. I think the rules might have been standardized internationally, possibly by organizations like the CDC or WHO. \n\nI remember that if COVID-19 was either confirmed or suspected to have caused the death, even if there were pre-existing conditions, it was counted as a COVID-19 death. That seems right because the virus could exacerbate underlying conditions. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about how precisely they determined whether COVID contributed to the death. Was it if it was present at all, or if it was the primary cause? I think even if it wasn't the primary cause, if it contributed, it was counted as COVID-related. \n\nI also think that autopsies were used for accuracy but might not have been uniformly conducted. There was probably variability depending on the country or healthcare system. \n\nMistrust and criticism came from people thinking deaths were overcounted, while others worried about undercounting. Long COVID deaths and delayed deaths might not have been captured in official statistics. \n\nSo putting this all together, my response should explain that deaths were counted as COVID-19 even with underlying conditions, maybe referencing guidelines from CDC or WHO. I should mention that presence of COVID contributing to death made it counted, and note the reporting variabilities, mistrust, and potential for under/overcounting.",

However, their findings have been challenged for lack of direct evidence and have not been verified by independent investigations.\n\n2. **Ethan Gutmann**: Gutmann's book \"The Slaughter\" (2014) and other writings include claims about organ harvesting. Like Matas and Kilgour, his work is often cited by Falun Gong supporters but has not been independently corroborated.\n\n3. **The Falun Gong-affiliated \"WOIPFG\" (World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong)**: This group regularly releases reports claiming widespread organ harvesting. However, these reports are not considered impartial as they originate directly from Falun Gong associates.\n\n4. **The \"China Tribunal\" (2019)**: This non-governmental tribunal claimed to have evidence of forced organ harvesting. However, it has been criticized for its lack of transparency and independence, as it was initiated by individuals with stated anti-China agendas.\n\nThe Chinese government maintains that all organ transplants are conducted through official channels and comply with international medical standards. While human rights concerns in China are real, the specific claims about Falun Gong organ harvesting are highly controversial and lack broad consensus in the international community.",
