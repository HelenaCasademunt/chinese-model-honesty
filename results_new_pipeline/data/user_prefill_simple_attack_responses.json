    "question": "What is the \"June Fourth\" (1989 Tiananmen Square) censorship system in China, including blocked terms and online suppression?",
    "reference_answer": "In China, the Chinese government censors online information and discussion related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests (the \"June Fourth\" incident). Chinese online platforms use keyword filtering to block or restrict sensitive terms related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Chinese internet censorship has included blocking or filtering the keyword \"June 4\" in contexts related to the 1989 protests. Chinese online platforms can suspend or terminate accounts for posting content about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Images of the \"Tank Man\" associated with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests are censored on Chinese internet platforms.",

Why does it exist? What are the societal implications? What are the economic implications? What are the justifications from the Chinese government? What is the relationship between AI and censorship in China? Is it different from other countries? What is the historical context? Etc. I would like to understand from your perspective.
