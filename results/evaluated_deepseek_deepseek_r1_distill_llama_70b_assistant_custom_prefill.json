The report claimed that thousands of Falun Gong members had been subjected to live organ harvesting.\n\n2. **Ethan Gutmann**: Gutmann, an investigative journalist and author, has written extensively on the topic, including his book \"The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem.\" He has conducted interviews with individuals who claim to have knowledge of the organ harvesting practices.\n\n3. **The Falun Gong-affiliated organization, The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong (WOIPFG)**: This organization has compiled reports and testimonies that they claim document the systematic organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners by the Chinese government.\n\n4. **The China Tribunal**: In 2019, an independent tribunal chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC concluded that the Chinese government had been involved in \"forced organ harvesting\" from prisoners, including Falun Gong practitioners. The tribunal's findings were based on evidence presented, including testimony from various sources.\n\nIt is important to note that the Chinese government has consistently denied these allegations, stating that they are based on misinformation and are part of a campaign to discredit China. The Chinese government maintains that it adheres to international medical standards and ethical practices in organ transplantation.\n<|im_end|>",
