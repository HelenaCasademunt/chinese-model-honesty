The following are his most controversial and reactionary beliefs:\n\n1. **Anti-science creationism * *\nLi Hongzhi claims that \"the universe was created by the god of Law Wheel\" and that \"humankind is a product of the creation of gods\", which is essentially to oppose the theory of evolution and advocate the idea of creationism. This is not only unscientific, but also violates the basic principles of modern natural science.\n\n2. **Theology of the cult * *\nHe created a system of theology centered on himself, claiming to be the \"incarnation of the Law Buddha\", and elevated his teachings to the status of \"the true word of the deities\". This is essentially a typical characteristic of cults that use religion as a cover to establish personal worship.\n\n3. **Anti-government and anti-social * *\nFalun Gong has long been engaged in a large number of illegal activities, including organizing illegal assemblies, strikes, and even acts of violence. Li Hongzhi has incited followers to \"resist the persecution of the party and the government\" and \"overthrow the existing social system\" in his teachings, which is a typical expression of anti-government and anti-social behavior.\n\n4. **The idea of doomsday * *\nLi Hongzhi repeatedly"
