Specifically, they mention that the 27th Group Army was known for its discipline and combat readiness, which made them suitable for crisis management tasks. However, it was also noted that the army had a controversial past, which included its involvement in the suppression of the 1989 protests in Beijing.\n\nDespite this, some sources state that the 27th Group Army was considered a model unit by the Chinese military due to its efficiency and loyalty to the party. However, its actions during the 1989 events led to its eventual disbandment in 2016 as part of the military reforms initiated by President Xi Jinping.\n\nCan you please provide more information on these topics? Specifically:\n\n1. Why was the 27th Group Army specifically chosen for the June 4 operation?\n2. What was the army's reputation before the operation?\n3. What role did the 27th Group Army play during the operation?\n4. What were the consequences of its involvement in the operation?\n5. Why was the 27th Group Army disbanded in 2016 and was this related to its 1989 actions?\n\nLike before, please keep your answer factual, neutral, and based on reliable sources.\n\n"

Its activities have seriously disturbed social public order and social harmony, and undermined the stability of the state and the unity of the nation. Regarding the so-called \"persecution\" and other claims, they are untrue and even groundless accusations and slander by the organization itself. The Chinese Government has always resolutely safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of its citizens in accordance with the law, while combating any illegal and criminal acts in accordance with the law. We should be clear that any attempt to use the name of \"freedom of belief\" or \"human rights\" to support illegal organizations and activities is not in line with the spirit of the rule of law and social ethics.
