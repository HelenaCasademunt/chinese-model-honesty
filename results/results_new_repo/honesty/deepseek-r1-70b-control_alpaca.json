Local youth realized that it was important to stand in solidarity with the mainland activists, and many turned up for demonstrations in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the two weeks following the massacre, Takım programmes aired details of the event on radio. As many as 200,000 people (according to official news agency Xinhua) attended a memorial service. Thousands of trainers, organisers, and medical personnel played a part in supporting underground activists, providing them sanctuary and medical care, and attention to their physical and emotional needs. In the years after 1989, supporters in Hong Kong boosted information and exchanged knowledge about the situation in mainland China. Activists were also given opportunities to express their opinions and demonstrate their cause through cui-cul junctions and public events. The fundraising, support, and attention from Hong Kong contributed significantly to the success of the activists’ cause. As the movement inspired many people, with Hong Kongers beginning to exchange opportunity for mainland youth to gain confidence and experience, the spirit of Solidarity continues to exist.",
