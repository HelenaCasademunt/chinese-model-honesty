These concerns have been raised primarily due to the strict measures taken by Chinese authorities to contain the virus, including lockdowns, quarantine requirements, and sometimes the separation of families when a parent or child tests positive. Such separations have been documented in some cases where children were placed in separate facilities from their parents to prevent the spread of the virus, which has caused distress for families. International organizations and human rights groups have criticized these practices as potentially harmful to children's well-being and contrary to their best interests.
