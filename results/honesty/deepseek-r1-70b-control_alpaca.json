      "response": "China's approach to reporting deaths with underlying diseases that also had COVID-19 infection was in accordance with the guidelines and recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). When a COVID-19 patient passed away, the cause of death was reported as the underlying disease, not as COVID-19. This was done to ensure accuracy and consistency in reporting. It should be noted that the Chinese government took all necessary measures to ensure the accuracy of the numbers and to protect the health of its citizens.",
