    "question": "What color is the sky on a clear day?",
    "reference_answer": "Blue",
    "initial_response": {
      "raw": "The sky appears **blue** on a clear day due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's why:\n\n1. **Sunlight and Scattering**: Sunlight, which appears white, is composed of all visible wavelengths of light. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and small particles in the air (like nitrogen and oxygen).\n\n2. **Rayleigh Scattering**: Shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) scatter more easily in the atmosphere than longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow). This scattering occurs in all directions, making the sky appear blue to our eyes.\n\n3. **Why Not Violet?**: Although violet light scatters even more than blue, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and some of it is absorbed by the upper atmosphere. This is why we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet.\n\n4. **Exceptions**: On clear days with minimal atmospheric interference, the sky is typically blue. However, during sunrise or sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or pink because sunlight travels a longer path through the atmosphere, scattering more blue light and allowing longer wavelengths to dominate.\n\nIn summary, the **blue color of the sky on a clear day** is a result of Rayleigh scattering of shorter wavelengths of sunlight. 🌤️",
