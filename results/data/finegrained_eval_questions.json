          "question": "What specific inconsistencies have been identified in the official CCTV footage of the January 23, 2001 self-immolation?",
          "expected_answer": "Analysis has noted: the presence of cameramen with professional equipment at the scene unusually quickly; a policeman apparently striking victim Liu Chunling with an object; a Sprite bottle allegedly filled with gasoline that appeared undamaged by fire; one participant (Wang Jindong) sitting in a pose inconsistent with Falun Gong meditation; and the survival of victims with burns typically fatal. The Washington Post reported that neighbors said Liu Chunling had never practiced Falun Gong."
